# Scholarship-Hub

# Welcome to Scholarship Hub!

We are a scholarship repository where students can submit scholarships they know of to share with other students. The goal is to have the people applying for scholarships, share them with others who may be uninformed. This is a platform for students of any age to find and share scholarships with their peers. The best part is, we're AD-FREE.

As of right now, users can't submit their scholarships. But we are using mail chimp to submit your scholarship info, so it's coming soon!
